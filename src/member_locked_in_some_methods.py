            If the previous node was inside a method, and the currentNode is not inside that method, then the method has ended, and we will check
            if any of the data members of the class were guarded or not in the method and compare this state to if they were guarded or not in a previous method.
            If either a data member was guarded in this method but not in another, or a data member was not guarded in this method but guarded in another, it will raise an error (and store it).
            After an error was raised or not, it will clear information of that method from the observer to make way for any future methods.
            
            If the previous node was inside a class, and the currentNode is not inside that class, then the class has ended, and we will clear
            all information about that class from the observer except the errors that class had, so it can make way for any future classes in the file.
