        # You're going to be working with libclang's CURSORS. Cursors are how we
        # navigate our C++ code, and are represented as a generic tree.
        # https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generic-treesn-array-trees/?ref=lbp
        #
        # Each cursor is a node in this tree. Each cursor can have any number of cursors
        # as its "children" below it. Cursors all point to a part of the code.
        #
        # You'll find many examples online on how to navigate these trees. Example:
        # https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generic-tree-level-order-traversal/
        #
        # Your task is to find all of the cursors with scopes that contain a given string.
        #
        # What does that mean?
        # Given the search string "return x + y", and the translation unit of following C++ program:
        '''
        int main(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
        void otherFunc()
        {
            notImportant();
        }
        '''
        # We'd want the function to return the cursor that points to all of 'main', as it 
        # contains "return x + y". This is so we can look at all of the other code contained 
        # in the 'main' scope later.
        #
        # I've already written a function that finds the (line, column) / (y, x) location of every
        # instance of the search string, so all you would need to do is:
        # 
        #       â€¢ for every location in search_location...
        #       â€¢ go through the generic cursor tree & find the closest cursor to that location
        #       â€¢ add it to cursor to cursor_list
        #
        # I believe that would return the cursor that contains the scope where our string is.
        # Run main.py to test this code!
        #
        # The test in main.py is looking for ".lock()". Ideally your function should return the
        # cursor that points to lines 42-46.
        #
        # There's also some documentation on how cursors, translation units, etc. work.
        # It's a bit confusingly written.
