# Using LLVM/Clang to detect anti-patterns in a large C++codebase
 Tool to find anti-patterns that can lead to deadlocks
 - Set of rules/heuristics which can automatically detect common locking
mistakes.
- Can be automatically run during PR/Review so that mistakes never
make it into the codebase.
- Aims to eliminate/minimise any false positives.
